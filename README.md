# BSONStream

Read a binary stream that contains BSON objects and emit each as a JavaScript
object. This module can be used in the browser with browserify.


## Example

Write each object of a BSON file created with mongodump to stdout:

    var fs = require('fs');
    var BSONStream = require('bson-stream');

    var rs = fs.createReadStream('/some/data.bson');

    rs.pipe(new BSONStream()).on('data', function(obj) {
      console.log(obj);
    });

Example with an object containing a Buffer object as a value. The Buffer will be
embedded when serialized by the BSON npm:

    var assert = require('assert');
    var bson = require('bson');
    var BSON = new bson.BSON();
    var BSONStream = require('bson-stream');

    var buf = new Buffer([65, 67, 70]); // 'ACF'
    var obj = { foo: buf };

    var bs = new BSONStream();
    bs.on('data', function(obj) {
      // the original Buffer value is embedded in a new BSON Buffer object and
      // stored at the `buffer` key
      assert.strictEqual(obj.foo.buffer.toString(), 'ACF');
    });

    bs.end(BSON.serialize(obj));


## Installation

    $ npm install bson-stream


## API

### BSONStream([opts])
* [opts] {Object} object containing optional parameters

opts:
* raw {Boolean, default false} whether to emit JavaScript objects or raw Buffers
* maxDocLength {Number, default 16777216} maximum BSON document size in bytes
* maxBytes {Number, default infinite} maximum number of bytes to receive
* debug {Boolean, default false} whether to do extra console logging or not
* hide {Boolean, default false} whether to suppress errors or not (used in tests)

Read a binary stream that contains BSON objects and emit each as a JavaScript
object (or as a Buffer if opts.raw is true).

Note: implements BSON specification 1.0 (http://bsonspec.org/spec.html), as
supported by js-bson (https://www.npmjs.org/package/bson).

Note2: Buffer objects will be embedded in a new BSON Buffer object at `buffer`.
